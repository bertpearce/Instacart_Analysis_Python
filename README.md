# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis Project

The Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis Project is a CareerFoundry Data Analytics certification project designed to showcase the Python-based analysis skills I've learned. The files in this repository are highlights from the assignments I've completed that build toward the final project involving moderately complex Python code I wrote to answer business questions that are communicated through a professional presentation.
